          I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computing Science at Simon Fraser
          University. My primary focus and inspiration for my studies are Web
          and Mobile Development.

          <p>
            I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly
            experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very
            committed towards my projects, and strive to better myself as a
            developer. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that
            require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set.

          <br />
          <p>
            I am experienced in both front and back-end development, and I am
            proficient in React, NodeJs, SQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Flutter to
            name a few. I am also familiar with Java, C/C++, Python ..

            And I believe that we are always eager to teach and help others to
            develop something special. We are the ones who can help the
